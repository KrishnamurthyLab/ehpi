Description: A unified interface to a set of eight epidemic models: SIR, SIRS, SIRD, SIRDS, SEIR, SEIRS, SEIRD, SEIRDS. Each model is configured with the same function, and the model that runs is determined by the function arguments alone.
 Epiehpi is a small, but effective and thoughtful single-function package which
 implements eight different compartmental epidemic models. The choice of model is
 determined by the provided arguments, with only the minimal set of arguments
 needed to distinguish one model from another being necessary; the default
 arguments of model parameters and model options are either irrelevant to other
 models, or are used in clever ways to disable or enable a compartment.
